## Description

Implementation of two algorithms in Java, Timsort and Quicksort, with support for both reference and primitive types. Experimental analyses were performed for educational purposes to compare the two algorithms.

## Timsort

Timsort is an algorithm that is efficient for sorting real-world data. Tim Peters developed Timsort for the Python programming language in 2001. Timsort analyzes the list it is trying to sort and then determines an appropriate approach based on that analysis.

## Compilation and Running the program

To compile and run the program use the below command:
        javac *.java
        java Evaluation

where ***Evaluation*** is the main driver to run the analysis.
